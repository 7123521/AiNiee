### Other Information
</summary>

* ` Multi-key Polling`
  >If you want to use multiple keys to share the consumption pressure and accelerate translation based on the number of keys, please use keys from the same type of account. When inputting, add an English comma between each key without line breaks. For example: key1,key2,key3

* ` Batch File Translation`
  >Simply place all files of the same type in the input folder. Multi-folder structures are also supported.

* ` Configuration Migration`
  >Configuration information is stored in the config.json file in the resource folder. When downloading a new version, you can copy it to the resource folder of the new version.
  
* `Cache Files`
   >When translation encounters problems, you can later change the translation project to cache files and select the folder containing the cache file in the input folder to continue translation. When continuing to translate Epub and Word files, you also need to place the original file and the cache file in the same folder.

* `Gemini Translation`
   >[Detailed introduction link](https://github.com/NEKOparapa/AiNiee/wiki/%E5%8F%8C%E5%AD%90%E6%98%9F%E7%BF%BB%E8%AF%91%E4%BB%8B%E7%BB%8D) A translation process with a dual-request structure, a new tool for experts to explore AI possibilities.
